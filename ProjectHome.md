Word List Trainer is a tool for foreign language learning. A frequently used technique when learning words is to use tables with the words in the mother language in one of the columns and the foreign words in the other. Word List Trainer makes it easy to create this kind of tables and to attach sounds to the words. The word lists can be exported to sound files that can be downloaded to e.g. mp3 players. It is possible to save the word lists in either a local database or a network database and to copy the word lists to and from the databases. This is a handy functionality when students are studying together and are learning the same words.

The first beta version of the program without any documentation is available from the [downloads section](http://code.google.com/p/wordlisttrainer/downloads/list).
